## üìã Overview

Mosyle is our current MDM provieder. We use it to automatically provision macOS and iOS devices for event operations and employees.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Zero-touch device provisioning using Apple Business Manager (ABM)
- Seamless user onboarding with pre-configured settings
- Automated app and profile deployment
- Warehouse operations deployment of event devices
- Enforce compliance through restrictions and policies
- Ongoing security and OS update management

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mosyle Configuration

- **Platform:** Mosyle Business (or Manager)
- **Integration:** Apple Business Manager (ABM), VPP, DEP
- **Device Types Managed:** macOS, iOS/iPadOS
- **Groups & Tags:** Device groups determine which profiles, apps or settings are installed on a device
- **Deployment Scripts & Tools:** Tools to streamline our deployment for a workflow and customized experience

---

## üöÄ Device Enrollment Process

1. **Device Assigned via ABM**

   - Devices are added to Mosyle via Apple Business Manager (ABM) Automated Device Enrollment (ADE). All devices inside our ABM account are by default assigned to Mosyle as the MDM server.

2. **Enrollment Profiles**

   - There are several device enrollment profiles that Mosyle deploys for us. They are as follows by device:
     - macOS:
       - AVFX-Employee (default profile for macOS)
       - AVFX-EventOps (manually assigned by serial number)
       - MDM Testing (used to test enrollment and new configurations)
     - iOS:
       - AVFX-Employee (Default profile for iOS)
       - AVFX-EventOps (Manually assigned by serial number)

3. **Enrollment Process**

   - When devices initially boot they require being connected to the internet.
   - Once connected they will communicate with ABM and determine that this device is managed.
   - It will prompt the user to click "Enroll".
   - Mosyle will deliver the enrollment profile based on the serial number of the device.

4. **Setup Assistant Configuration**

   - Depending on the enrollment profile a user will be show setup assistant screens.
   - Devices assigned to AVFX-EventOps will not display options for setup.

5. **Post-Enrollment Tasks**
   - A default user will be installed
